## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/omersafakoglu/arimaforthyaois.git
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the code.

## Requirements

### Python 3.6 or higher

### statsmodels

### pandas

### numpy

### matplotlib

### scikit-learn


## Dataset

This project utilizes historical price data for the THYAO.IS stock. Data can be downloaded from Yahoo Finance

## Model Development

The ARIMA model is developed through the following steps:

1.Data preprocessing.

2.Determining model parameters (p, d, q).

3.Training the model.

4.Making predictions.


## Results

### Model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

-Mean Squared Error (MSE)

-Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)

-Results indicate the accuracy of the predictions and the overall performance of the model.
